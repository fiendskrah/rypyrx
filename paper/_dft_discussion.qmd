Note that since `pixi` also installs binary dependencies, the install is
complete with tricky deps like GDAL and the correct GCC compiler (hello windows
friends!). That lets you R people use `install.packages` for anything that's not
(yet) on conda and your build system is guaranteed to work (though you wont have
a lockfile for those packages).

Thus, you get a sandboxed install for this project, with *all deps on all
platforms*, and dependencies *right inside the repo*. Just like `npm` (if that's
your kinda thing). This is especially nice for making sure your analysis
environment isn't broken by the evolving ecosystem while your paper is under
review.
