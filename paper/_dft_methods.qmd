We often say that *spatial is special* because of two phenomena known as spatial
dependence and spatial heterogeneity
[@anselinWhatSpecialSpatial1989; @anselinSpatialEconometricsMethods1988]. Two
classic spatial econometric models designed to handle these effects include
the*Spatial Lag Model*, defined as

$$y = \rho Wy + \beta X + \epsilon$$

and the *Spatial Error Model* defined as

add the library in the `header-includes` section of the quarto yaml

where you want to set the alignment

$$
\begin{split}
y & = \beta X + u\\
u & = \lambda W u + \epsilon
\end{split}
$$

The real point being that you can dropdown to real latex any time you need to.
